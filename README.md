# Project-Bike-Sharing

This is the first project I built in the coursework for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program. In this project, I am able to built a feed forward neural network that can predict the daily bike rental ridership. This project only use the Numpy python library to help me understand the underlying concepts happening behind the neural network before using the deep learning framework 'Pytorch'.


# Result

The prediction perform by neural network is precise. However, the prediction is slightly overestimated by the application as there is no sufficient training data in the month of the december as seen in the below image.

<b> As seen in the images, the model overestimate from december 21 to the end of the december. </b>
